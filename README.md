# Disclaimer
Note: I do not condone piracy, please use this only for backing up your own physical media you have bought. A lot of work goes into making a movie, make sure they get the support they need by buying your movies legally. 

# PowerShell
Documentation to be updated, powershell version [DVDFab.ps1](DVDFab.ps1) has been created, the VBScript is depreciated. The Script can be installed as a service by using the -Install Parameter when running the script. Please note when running as a service you will need to use the mobile DVDFab Remote app to monitor progress, this is due to the secure desktop no longer being supported on modern versions of windows, so you will not see the GUI.
